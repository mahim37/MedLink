# Medical NFTs: MedLink

This project aims to create a platform for managing medical documents using NFTs (non-fungible tokens). NFTs are unique digital assets that can represent anything from art to music to medical data.

## Problem Statement

- Managing medical documents is inconvenient for both patients and doctors. Patients have to keep track of their records and share them with different doctors. Doctors have to store and access large amounts of data from various sources.
- Data that doctors collect is insecure and patients lose control. Medical data is often stored on centralized servers that are vulnerable to hacking or data breaches. Patients have no way of knowing who has access to their data or how it is used.
- It is hard for advertisers and researchers to buy data without dummy data. Advertisers and researchers need accurate and relevant medical data for their purposes, but they often have to deal with dummy data that is unreliable or unethical.

## Solution and Benefits

### User Benefits

- Security: NFTs could help ensure the privacy and security of medical data. Blockchain technology, which is often used to create NFTs, is known for its security features such as immutability and encryption. This means that medical data stored on a blockchain could be more secure and less susceptible to hacking or data breaches.
- Verification of authenticity: NFTs can be used to verify the authenticity of medical documents, such as patient records and diagnostic reports. This could help prevent fraud and improve patient safety.
- Control of data: Patients can have more control over their own data by using NFTs. They can decide who can access their data and for what purpose. They can also opt to sell their data to advertisers or researchers who are interested in it. They will know who buys their data and how much they pay for it.
- Burnable copy of data: Patients can choose to burn their copy of the data after selling it or sharing it with someone else. This would ensure that they do not have duplicate copies of the same data that could cause confusion or conflict.

### Doctor Benefits

- One stop access to data: Doctors can use NFTs to access all the relevant medical data of their patients in one place. They do not have to deal with multiple sources or formats of data. They can also update the data as needed, such as adding new medications or procedures.
- Storage of medical records on Blockchain: Doctors can use ETH (Ethereum) as a storage medium for their medical records. ETH is a cryptocurrency that can be used to pay for transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. By storing their records on ETH, doctors can save money on storage costs and also earn rewards for validating transactions.

## Implementation

This project uses smart contracts written in Solidity language to create and manage NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain. It also uses OpenZeppelin library, which provides reusable and secure code for common functionalities such as ERC721 standard, which defines how NFTs should work.

The project consists of three main components:

- A web interface that allows users to interact with the smart contracts and view their NFTs.
- A backend server that handles the communication between the web interface and the smart contracts.
- A database that stores the metadata of the NFTs, such as name, description, image URL, etc.

The project follows these steps:

1. A user registers on the web interface and creates an account with a wallet address.
2. A user uploads their medical document (such as a PDF file) on the web interface
